The \"brown object\" mentioned in the question is likely the small brown item on the top shelf of the wooden unit, which appears to be a decorative bowl or figurine. From the 2D perspective, the area directly in front of this object is occupied by the lower shelves and the items on them. However, without depth information, it is ambiguous whether the space in front of the object is physically available (e.g., not blocked by the shelf itself) or if the object is simply positioned at the edge of the shelf.
