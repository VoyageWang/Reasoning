This suggests the entire figure has been rotated, making the x-axis labels hard to read and the bar heights ambiguous. To accurately compare Malaysia’s bars (yellow) across the years and determine the second lowest, I should first correct the orientation so text reads naturally left-to-right and the bars stand upright. I will rotate the image to make the labels and legend readable, then reassess the three Malaysia bars by relative height.</think>"}, {"type": "latent", "helper_image": "codevision_images/sample1_1.png"}, {"type": "text", "content": "<think>Now the chart is upright: the x-axis along the bottom shows the year labels left-to-right, the legend is readable, and the y-axis text is oriented normally.
